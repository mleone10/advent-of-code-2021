# Advent of Code 2021
> Solutions to 2021's daily challenges

This year's solutions are written in TypeScript!  I'm still figuring this language out, but some requirements are probably:
* Node
* NPM

# Build
Solutions must be compiled from TypeScript to JavaScript before they can be run:
```bash
npx tsc
```

# Execute
Solutions are designed to accept input from STDIN:
```bash
cat days/day1/day1.txt | node dist/day1.js
```
